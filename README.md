# GitHubIntro
Instructions and Simple test cases for my Recommended use of GitHub

*This is purely experimental material; please keep this in mind.*

The ReadMe (should all be in capital to keep up with GitHub standard) file is an introductory note which should point towards further material, e.g.,
- how to get install your code base (one branch for each specific platform) ...
- how to get startet using your code (again one for ecah specific User-profile).
- how to understand your product (for decisions maker; one for each major useCase).
The ReadMe file should be short (not more than 24 lines), be kept in plain text (cf. this MarDown style), while the material referenced in todays standards should point to different entries on a webSite.

My major recommendations for now.
